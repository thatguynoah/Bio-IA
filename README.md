# Bio-IA
Biology IA 2021-22. Project for using vanilla forward feeding neural network for computing likely hood of cancer relapse.


Project uses keras API to design neural network stemming from pandas DF. Pandas df is generated from combining data from NCBI GEO daatset of patients who had relapses of cancer. Data was nromalized using quantile transformer from Scikit-Learn.
